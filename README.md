[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/7c999fe1-0ef0-4794-8099-0aea6a9ed1c2/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/blenderai/deploys)

Blender Reinforcement Learning (BlenderAI) is an innovative AI-powered solution designed to automate 3D modeling, animation, and various Blender tasks using reinforcement learning (RL). By integrating Python Blender scripts and OpenUSD (Universal Scene Description), BlenderAI delivers a robust platform for creating, sharing, and managing 3D assets with ease.

## **Key Features**
1. **Reinforcement Learning in Blender**:
   - RL agents trained to perform complex Blender tasks by mapping software controls to optimal actions for specific goals.
   - Applications include creating 3D models, animating existing models, and executing user-defined tasks.

2. **OpenUSD Integration**:
   - **Interoperability**: Enables seamless data exchange across various 3D tools (e.g., Blender, Maya, Houdini).
   - **Scalability**: Handles large, complex scenes efficiently using OpenUSD's hierarchical structure.
   - **Collaboration**: Facilitates consistent asset sharing and collaborative workflows.

3. **Plugin for Blender**:
   - **User-Friendly Interface**: Input commands via text or voice in Blender's 3D viewport.
   - **Task Automation**: Commands are executed by the RL model, streamlining 3D creation.

## **Installation**
1. Download the plugin file `BRL.py` and save it to your Blender addons folder.
2. Open Blender and navigate to **Edit > Preferences > Add-ons**.
3. Search for "Reinforcement Learning" and enable the plugin.
4. Save preferences to make the plugin available every time Blender starts.

## **Usage**
### **Typing Commands**
- Enter commands in the provided text field and click "Submit" to execute tasks via the RL model.

### **Using Microphone**
- Click the microphone icon to record voice commands (5 seconds) and send them to the RL model.
- Note: Install the `sounddevice` module for this feature.

## **OpenUSD Workflow**
1. **Exporting Assets**:
   - Use OpenUSD to save generated 3D models, animations, and scenes for reuse in other software or workflows.
2. **Data Interoperability**:
   - Easily integrate BlenderAI assets with tools like Maya, Houdini, or Unreal Engine for a seamless pipeline.
3. **Collaborative Training**:
   - Store and share RL training data, such as scene configurations and control actions, using OpenUSD for reproducibility.

---

## **Code Overview**
The plugin is implemented in a single file, `BRL.py`, which contains:
1. **Import Statements**: Required modules for Blender and RL integration.
2. **Custom Operator Classes**:
   - `RequestModelOperator`: Sends user commands to the RL model.
   - `UseMicrophoneOperator`: Records and processes audio commands.
3. **UI Panel**:
   - Adds a panel to Blenderâ€™s 3D viewport for text and voice input.
4. **Register and Unregister Functions**:
   - Manage plugin activation and deactivation.

## **Future Plans**
- Extend RL agent capabilities to support more advanced modeling and animation tasks.
- Leverage OpenUSD for RL model output, enabling faster workflows and multi-tool compatibility.
- Introduce a feedback loop for user ratings to refine RL agent performance.
